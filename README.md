# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the school district analysis is to use school and student data obtained from csv files to establish trends in math scores, reading scores, and passing percentages with respect to factors including school spending, size, type, and grade of the students. A summary of statistics for the district and each school will also be provided. Addditionally, the grading data for math and reading scores that needed to be removed for 9th grade students from Thomas High School and the trends established along with the summaries need to be adjusted accordingly.
